Project Description

The Wixdora Shop is a mini e-commerce website designed to simulate a real online shopping experience. The project demonstrates all the skills and concepts learned in this web design course, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, responsive design, DOM manipulation, form validation, asynchronous data fetching, and session management. The website is fully responsive, accessible, and interactive.
